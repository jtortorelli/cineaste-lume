A graduate of the second "Toho New Face" audition class in 1947 (joining alongside Sugi Yôko and Shiozawa Toki), Imaizumi Ren was a prolific supporting player in the studio's productions throughout the 1950s.

He frequently appeared in _tokusatsu_ films, playing minor roles such as a radio operator in _Godzilla_ (1954) and a scientist in _Rodan_ (1956). He retired from screen acting around 1960.

After leaving the screen, he remained in the industry as an educator, serving as a lecturer for the Toho Theater Club and later establishing his own actor training center at his home.
