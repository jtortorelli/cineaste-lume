A bright and energetic star of Toho's golden age, Hoshi Yuriko was recruited by
the studio after winning a "Miss Cinderella" beauty contest in 1958.

She rose to national fame as the perennial love interest Sumiko in the
long-running _Young Guy_ (_Wakadaishô_) film series, starring alongside Kayama
Yûzô. Her chemistry with Kayama was a key factor in the series' massive
popularity during the 1960s.

To international audiences, she is best known for her roles in the Godzilla
franchise. She played the intrepid reporter Nakanishi Junko in _Mothra vs.
Godzilla_ (1964) and Shindô Naoko in _Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster_
(1964). Unlike the typical "damsel in distress" roles of the era, Hoshi's
characters were often professional, modern women who actively participated in
the plot. She returned to the series decades later as a scientist in _Godzilla
vs. Megaguirus_ (2000).

She remained active in film and television until her death from lung cancer
in 2018. Her memorial service was attended by her longtime friends and co-stars,
including Takarada Akira, Kayama Yûzô, and Tsukasa Yôko.
