Dan Ikuma was born into a distinguished family; his grandfather was Baron Dan
Takuma, who was assassinated in the League of Blood incident in 1932. This
tragedy, and its aftermath, inspired Dan to pursue music. His father was
businessman Dan Inô.

He trained at the Tokyo School of Music and graduated in 1946. Dan became a
prolific composer, creating over 200 film scores, including the music for the
_Samurai_ trilogy (1954-1956) and _The Last War_ (1961).

Beyond film, Dan was a celebrated classical composer. His 1952 opera _Yuzuru_
(_Twilight Crane_) is considered a masterpiece of modern Japanese opera. He also
composed the "Olympic Games Overture" for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

Dan often collaborated with fellow composers Akutagawa Yasushi and Mayuzumi
Toshirô. In addition to his musical achievements, he was an accomplished
essayist, receiving the Yomiuri Prize for Literature in 1968.

Asteroid 17509 was named "Ikumadan" in his honor.
