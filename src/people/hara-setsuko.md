Dropped out of school in 1935 and joined Nikkatsu studios.

Appeared in Arnold Fanck's <i>The Daughter of the Samurai</i> in 1937, the first
German-Japanese co-production. She attended a preview of the film in Berlin with
Adolf Hitler and other Nazi party leaders. The film was classified as propaganda
and was prevented from release in nations that fell outside the Anti-Comintern
pact.

Later transferred to Toho and appeared in several war movies. By the war's end
she had earned a reputation and could choose her own work.

Worked frequently with director Ozu Yasujirô.

Retired after appearing in Inagaki Hiroshi's <i>Chushingura</i> in 1962 and
lived in seclusion under her death in 2015.
