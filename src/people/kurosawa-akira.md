Regarded by many as one of the greatest filmmakers in cinema history, Kurosawa
Akira originally aspired to be a painter—a talent that would later define the
striking visual composition of his films. He entered the film industry in 1936
at P.C.L. (later Toho), where he forged a lifelong friendship with fellow
assistant director and future _Godzilla_ helmer Honda Ishirô.

Kurosawa's "Golden Age" in the 1950s and 60s produced a string of masterpieces
that revolutionized world cinema, including _Rashomon_ (1950), _Ikiru_ (1952),
_Seven Samurai_ (1954), and _Yojimbo_ (1961). Many of these classics starred his
muse, Mifune Toshirô, though their legendary collaboration ended acrimoniously
after _Red Beard_ (1965).

The late 60s and 70s were a dark period for the director, marked by the
commercial failure of _Dodes'ka-den_ (1970) and a suicide attempt. However, he
staged a magnificent comeback with the Soviet-backed _Dersu Uzala_ (1975) and a
pair of Shakespearean epics, _Kagemusha_ (1980) and _Ran_ (1985), which were
produced with the assistance of admirers George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola.
His old friend Honda Ishirô returned to his side as a creative consultant and
second-unit director for these final triumphs.
