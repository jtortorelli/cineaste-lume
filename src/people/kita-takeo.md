Born in Osaka, Kita Takeo began his career at Photo Chemical Laboratories
(P.C.L.), the predecessor to Toho. He quickly established himself in the
industry, becoming the first director of the Japan Film and Television Art
Director Association upon its founding in 1939.

He is best known for his extensive collaboration with director Honda Ishirô,
serving as the art director for many of Toho's most famous tokusatsu films,
including the original _Godzilla_ (1954), _King Kong vs. Godzilla_ (1962), and
_Destroy All Monsters_ (1968). His set designs helped define the look of the
studio's Golden Age of sci-fi.

In the 1960s, Kita took on significant executive roles, becoming Toho's General
Production Manager in 1961 and later the President and Representative Director
of Toho Built in 1962. He passed away in 1979.
