A ubiquitous supporting actor who appeared in numerous films exclusively for Toho throughout the 50s and 60s, and even in the 70s after the contract system had dissolved.

He very rarely had speaking roles, his most prominent ones being in <i>Rodan</i> (1956) and <i>Varan the Unbelievable</i> (1958).
