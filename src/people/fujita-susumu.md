Fujita Susumu was a powerful actor who rose to fame as the star of Kurosawa Akira's debut film, *Sanshiro Sugata* (1943). His portrayal of the title character established his "tough guy" persona, a stoic and morally upright hero that resonated with wartime audiences. He reprised the role in *Sanshiro Sugata: Part Two* (1945) and continued to collaborate with Kurosawa in films like *The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail* (1945) and *The Hidden Fortress* (1958), where he played the rival General Tadokoro.

In the post-war era, Fujita became a familiar face in Toho's tokusatsu productions, often cast as high-ranking military officials due to his commanding presence. He played General Morita in *The Mysterians* (1957), the Defense Commander in *Atragon* (1963), and led the JSDF task force in *Mothra vs. Godzilla* (1964).

Fujita appeared in over 180 films throughout his career, transitioning to television roles in his later years. He passed away in 1990 from liver cancer.
