Fujita Susumu was a powerful actor who rose to fame as the star of Kurosawa
Akira's debut film, _Sanshiro Sugata_ (1943). His portrayal of the title
character established his "tough guy" persona, a stoic and morally upright hero
that resonated with wartime audiences. He reprised the role in _Sanshiro Sugata:
Part Two_ (1945) and continued to collaborate with Kurosawa in films like _The
Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail_ (1945) and _The Hidden Fortress_ (1958),
where he played the rival General Tadokoro.

In the post-war era, Fujita became a familiar face in Toho's tokusatsu
productions, often cast as high-ranking military officials due to his commanding
presence. He played General Morita in _The Mysterians_ (1957), the Defense
Commander in _Atragon_ (1963), and led the JSDF task force in _Mothra vs.
Godzilla_ (1964).

Fujita appeared in over 180 films throughout his career, transitioning to
television roles in his later years. He passed away in 1990 from liver cancer.
