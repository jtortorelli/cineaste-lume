bio:
  - Born in Hokkaido and raised in community with the native Ainu populace. Ainu music later influenced his own composing style.
  - Obeyed his father's urging to study forestry, but continued to teach himself music in his spare time.
  - At age 21, his work <i>Japanese Rhapsody</i> won an international young composers' contest promoted by Russian composer Alexander Tcherepnin. Ifukube received formal musical education from Tcherepnin in 1936.
  - Drafted into the army and assigned to study the structure of wooden fighter planes flown by the Allied forces. His work involved constant exposure to x-rays and fell ill from overexposure in 1945. He listened to the Japanese surrender on the radio from his sickbed.
  - After leaving the army he was encouraged by Hayasaka Fumio to pursue film music to make a living. He had severe arguments with director Kurosawa Akira and Taniguchi Senkichi, but also befriended the blacklisted Tsuburaya Eiji. Tsuburaya and Ifukube were reunited on the set of <i>Godzilla</i> (1954), the first of many <i>kaiju eiga</i> scored by Ifukube.
  - Credited with inventing Godzilla's iconic roar.
  - First retired from film music after <i>Terror of Mechagodzilla</i> (1975). During the 80s he revised several of his pre-war concert works to incorporate themes from his film works, and wrote a new work, <i>Symphonic Fantasia</i>, to celebrate his science fiction and fantasy scores.
  - He disapproved of the pop arrangement of his music in <i>Godzilla vs. Biollante</i> (1989) and came out of retirement to score four more Godzilla films in the 90s, retiring again after <i>Godzilla vs. Destoroyah</i> (1995).
