Born in Gunma Prefecture, Kobayashi Keiju originally dropped out of Nihon
University to pursue an acting career, making his film debut at Nikkatsu
in 1942. His career was interrupted during World War II when he was drafted into
the Imperial Army and sent to China.

After the war, he returned to the screen and moved to Toho in 1956, where he
found immense popularity as a salaryman archetype in the long-running "Company
President" (_Shachô_) comedy series, often starring alongside Morishige Hisaya.

While famous for comedy, Kobayashi was also a highly respected dramatic actor.
He won multiple awards, including Best Actor at the Mainichi Film Concours for
his role as Kiyoshi Yamashita in _The Naked General_ (1958). He gave memorable
performances as Dr. Tadokoro in the disaster epic _Submersion of Japan_ (1973)
and as Prime Minister Mitamura in _The Return of Godzilla_ (1984).

He continued working in film and television until his death from heart failure
in 2010.
