Born Yamada Kôji in Tokyo, Kayama Shigeru began his writing career while working for the Ministry of Finance, initially penning _tanka_ poems. His major breakthrough came in 1946 when his short story "Orang Pendek's Revenge" won a contest held by _The Jewel_ magazine. The story, featuring a mysterious ape-like creature, established his reputation for "cryptozoology" style fiction and allowed him to become a full-time writer by 1949.

In 1954, Toho producer Tanaka Tomoyuki recruited Kayama to develop the story for a new giant monster film. Kayama's draft for _Godzilla_ (1954) introduced many of the film's core elements, including the creature effectively being a living nuclear weapon. He also wrote the original story for the sequel _Godzilla Raids Again_ (1955) and the yeti-themed _Half Human_ (1955).

Kayama also adapted the story for _The Mysterians_ (1957) and continued to write until his death in 1975. His novella adaptations of the first two Godzilla films remain highly regarded by fans.
