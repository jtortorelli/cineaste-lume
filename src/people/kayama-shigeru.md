Author of speculative fiction best known for writing the original story used as the template for <i>Godzilla</i> (1954).

He began his writing career while working in the Ministry of Finance in 1940. Won a sweepstakes in 1946 for a short story titled <i>Orang-Pendek's Revenge</i>. It became the first in a series of stories that allowed him to leave his ministry job and work full-time as a writer.

The second entry in the <i>Orang-Pendek</i> series won the Japan Detective Writer Club's Newcomer Award.

Originally wrote <i>Godzilla</i> as a radio drama, which was broadcast before the film's premiere.

Later adapted Okami Jôjirô's work <i>The Mysterians</i> for the film of the same name in 1957.
