A Turkish-born business executive who lived in Tokyo, Hughes became a familiar
face in Japanese cinema as the go-to actor for distinguished Westerners. Despite
not being fluent in Japanese, he appeared in numerous films for Toho, usually
dubbed by voice actors.

Unlike many other foreign extras of the time who were often cast in minor
background roles, Hughes frequently landed significant supporting parts. He was
often typecast as high-ranking officials, scientists, or international diplomats
given his dignified appearance. His roles included the Australian Prime Minister
in _Submersion of Japan_ (1973), Dr. Stevenson in _Destroy All Monsters_ (1968),
and even Adolf Hitler in the comedy _Crazy Adventure_ (1965).

He also worked behind the scenes, serving as a liaison between Japanese crews
and foreign talent, notably on _The Last War_ (1961). He remained active in the
Japanese film industry until the mid-1980s before retiring to France.
