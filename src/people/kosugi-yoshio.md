A fixture of the Japanese screen for decades, Kosugi Yoshio began his career in
the _shingeki_ theater before joining P.C.L. (the predecessor to Toho) in 1935.
Balancing his stage commitments with a busy filming schedule, he became a
reliable character actor known for his earthy, robust presence.

International audiences recognize him best as Mosuke, one of the farmers seeking
protection, in Kurosawa Akira's masterpiece _Seven Samurai_ (1954). However, he
was also a staple of Honda Ishirô's special effects films, playing captains,
chiefs, and military men in _Mothra_ (1961), _King Kong vs. Godzilla_ (1962),
and _Mothra vs. Godzilla_ (1964).

Beyond his acting credits, Kosugi served as an instructor at Toho's acting
school, where he mentored future stars like Sahara Kenji and Tsuchiya Yoshio. He
passed away in 1968.
