Drafted into the Japanese army at age 19. His wartime experience gave him a
lifelong disgust with Japanese society in general. He became an anarchist and
openly denied the legitimacy of the Japanese government and the imperial system.

He enrolled in the University of Tokyo's Faculty of Law after the war, aspiring
to become a diplomat, but dropped out due to his disillusionment with the
political climate. He then turned to acting, joining the Actors' Studio Theatre
Company in 1954.

Amamoto was frequently cast by director Okamoto Kihachi, appearing in films such
as _The Age of Assassins_ (1967), _Kill!_ (1968), and _Japan's Longest Day_
(1967). He was often cast in roles as older, more grotesque characters, despite
being the same age as his co-stars.

He is perhaps best known for his role as the villainous Dr. Shinigami in the
_Kamen Rider_ series.

Fond of Spain and Spanish culture, he visited the country over 20 times and was
an admirer of the poet Federico García Lorca.
