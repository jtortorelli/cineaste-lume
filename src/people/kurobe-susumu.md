Known to millions as the human face of a hero, Kurobe Susumu is immortalized in
pop culture history as Hayata Shin, the Science Patrol member who transforms
into the titular giant in the original _Ultraman_ (1966). He has reprised this
role in numerous sequels and spin-offs over the decades.

In a stark contrast to his television persona, Kurobe's film career at Toho
often saw him cast as villains, assassins, and henchmen. He played a
cold-blooded assassin in _Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster_ (1964) and a
henchman for the evil Dr. Who in _King Kong Escapes_ (1967).

His legacy in the franchise extends to the next generation; his daughter,
Yoshimoto Takami, starred as the female lead Yanase Rena in _Ultraman Tiga_
(1996). Father and daughter notably shared the screen in the 2008 film _Great
Decisive Battle! The Super 8 Ultra Brothers_.
