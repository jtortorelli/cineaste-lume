Arikawa Sadamasa served as a bomber pilot during World War II. After the war, he
briefly joined Toho but left due to labor disputes. He then joined Tsuburaya
Eiji's private film effects company while Tsuburaya was blacklisted from the
studio system.

When Tsuburaya returned to Toho, Arikawa followed him and became his chief
cameraman, working on nearly all of Toho's science fiction films from 1954
to 1965. He was a key figure in developing the visual style of the _Godzilla_
series and other _kaiju_ films.

In 1967, Arikawa became the second individual to officially bear the title
"Director of Special Effects" at Toho with the release of _Son of Godzilla_. He
continued in this role for _Destroy All Monsters_ (1968) and _Space Amoeba_
(1970), often with Tsuburaya supervising.

Arikawa departed Toho in 1970 following the death of his mentor, Tsuburaya Eiji.
