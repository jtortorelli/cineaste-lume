Arishima Ichirô apprenticed under comedic actor Tamura Kunio in 1933. He toured
with various comedy troupes during World War II before shooting to fame with a
breakout performance on NHK Radio's _Sunday Entertainment Board_ (_Nichiyô
Gorakuban_).

He made his film debut in 1947 and joined Toho in 1955, where he became a
household name. Often referred to as "The Japanese Chaplin," Arishima starred in
several long-running comedy series, including the _Company President_ (_Shachô_)
series and the _Young Guy_ (_Wakadaishô_) series.

Internationally, he is best known for his role as the frantic publicity director
Mr. Tako in _King Kong vs. Godzilla_ (1962).

Arishima became a free agent after his Toho contract expired in 1972. He
continued appearing in television and theater until declining health forced him
to withdraw.
