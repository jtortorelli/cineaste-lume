Arishima Ichirô apprenticed under comedic actor Tamura Kunio in 1933. He toured with various comedy troupes during World War II before shooting to fame with a breakout performance on NHK Radio's *Sunday Entertainment Board* (*Nichiyô Gorakuban*).

He made his film debut in 1947 and joined Toho in 1955, where he became a household name. Often referred to as "The Japanese Chaplin," Arishima starred in several long-running comedy series, including the *Company President* (*Shachô*) series and the *Young Guy* (*Wakadaishô*) series.

Internationally, he is best known for his role as the frantic publicity director Mr. Tako in *King Kong vs. Godzilla* (1962).

Arishima became a free agent after his Toho contract expired in 1972. He continued appearing in television and theater until declining health forced him to withdraw.
