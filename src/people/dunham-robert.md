bio:

  - His Mark Jackson role in <i>Dogora</i> (1964) was so popular that there were talks of a spin-off film focused on the character.
  - He was pitched for the role of the American scientist in <i>Frankenstein Conquers the World</i> (1965) but lost the part to Nick Adams.
  - Best remembered as Emperor Antonion in <i>Godzilla vs. Megalon</i> (1973), featured on <i>Mystery Science Theater 3000</i>.
