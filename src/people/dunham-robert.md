Robert Dunham was an American actor, writer, and entrepreneur who lived in Japan
for over two decades. Born in Maine and raised in Massachusetts, he served as a
lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps during the Korean War before being
stationed in Yokohama.

Dunham distinguished himself from other Western actors in Japan by his fluency
in the Japanese language, which allowed him to interact directly with his
co-stars and often deliver his own lines without dubbing. He became a regular in
Toho's special effects films, most notably playing the diamond investigator Mark
Jackson in _Dogora_ (1964). The character was so popular that Toho considered a
spin-off series, but it never materialized.

He is perhaps best remembered by international audiences as Emperor Antonio of
Seatopia in _Godzilla vs. Megalon_ (1973), where he also did double duty as a
motorcycle stuntman. His other credits include _Mothra_ (1961), _The Green
Slime_ (1968), and _ESPY_ (1974).

After returning to the United States in 1975, Dunham worked as a freelance
writer for publications like _Car and Driver_ and founded his own production
company, writing and directing the film _Samantha_.
