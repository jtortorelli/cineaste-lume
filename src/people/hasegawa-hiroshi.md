A prolific character actor, Hasegawa Hiroshi is best known as a frequent collaborator of director Okamoto Kihachi. Born in Tokyo, he made his screen debut in Okamoto's _Operation Rats_ in 1962.

Over the following decade, he became a staple of the "Okamoto Group" of actors, appearing in films such as _Samurai Assassin_ (1965), _Japan's Longest Day_ (1967), _Age of Assassins_ (1967), and _Kill!_ (1968). With his distinct features, he excelled in playing antagonists, often cast as small-time villains, rough-edged soldiers, yakuza underlings, or corrupt officials.

Beyond his film work with Toho, he maintained a steady presence on Japanese television, appearing in numerous jidaigeki and detective dramas well into the 1990s.
