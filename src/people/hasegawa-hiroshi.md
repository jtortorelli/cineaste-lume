A prolific character actor, Hasegawa Hiroshi is best known as a frequent
collaborator of director Okamoto Kihachi. Born in Tokyo, he made his screen
debut in Okamoto's _Operation Rats_ in 1962.

Over the following decade, he became a staple of the "Okamoto Group" of actors,
appearing in films such as _Samurai Assassin_ (1965), _Japan's Longest Day_
(1967), _Age of Assassins_ (1967), and _Kill!_ (1968). With his distinct
features, he excelled in playing antagonists, often cast as small-time villains,
rough-edged soldiers, yakuza underlings, or corrupt officials.

Beyond his film work with Toho, he maintained a steady presence on Japanese
television, appearing in numerous jidaigeki and detective dramas well into the
1990s.
