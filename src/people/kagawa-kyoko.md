Kagawa Kyôko (born Ikebe Kyôko) is one of the most celebrated actresses in
Japanese cinema history, known for her naturalistic performances and extensive
work with the Golden Age's greatest directors. She initially aspired to be a
ballerina but turned to acting after being rejected from ballet school due to
her age. She made her screen debut in 1950 with _Mado kara tobidase_.

Kagawa is renowned for her collaborations with the "Four Great Masters" of
Japanese film: Ozu Yasujirô (_Tokyo Story_), Mizoguchi Kenji (_Sansho the
Bailiff_, _The Crucified Lovers_), Kurosawa Akira (_The Bad Sleep Well_, _High
and Low_, _Red Beard_), and Naruse Mikio (_Mother_, _Sudden Rain_). Her ability
to portray a wide range of characters, from devoted daughters to defiant wives,
made her a favorite of these legendary filmmakers.

To _tokusatsu_ fans, she is best known for her role as the photographer Michi in
_Mothra_ (1961). Although she rarely appeared in science fiction, her
performance in the film is fondly remembered.

In 1965, Kagawa married Takuji Makino and moved to New York City, putting her
career on hiatus. She returned to Japan and acting in 1968, transitioning
seamlessly into television and stage roles while continuing to appear in films.
In recognition of her contributions to the arts, she received the Medal with
Purple Ribbon in 1998 and the FIAF Award in 2011 for her work in film
preservation.
