Kagawa Kyôko (born Ikebe Kyôko) is one of the most celebrated actresses in Japanese cinema history, known for her naturalistic performances and extensive work with the Golden Age's greatest directors. She initially aspired to be a ballerina but turned to acting after being rejected from ballet school due to her age. She made her screen debut in 1950 with *Mado kara tobidase*.

Kagawa is renowned for her collaborations with the "Four Great Masters" of Japanese film: Ozu Yasujirô (*Tokyo Story*), Mizoguchi Kenji (*Sansho the Bailiff*, *The Crucified Lovers*), Kurosawa Akira (*The Bad Sleep Well*, *High and Low*, *Red Beard*), and Naruse Mikio (*Mother*, *Sudden Rain*). Her ability to portray a wide range of characters, from devoted daughters to defiant wives, made her a favorite of these legendary filmmakers.

To *tokusatsu* fans, she is best known for her role as the photographer Michi in *Mothra* (1961). Although she rarely appeared in science fiction, her performance in the film is fondly remembered.

In 1965, Kagawa married Takuji Makino and moved to New York City, putting her career on hiatus. She returned to Japan and acting in 1968, transitioning seamlessly into television and stage roles while continuing to appear in films. In recognition of her contributions to the arts, she received the Medal with Purple Ribbon in 1998 and the FIAF Award in 2011 for her work in film preservation.
