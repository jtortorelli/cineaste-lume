Fujiwara Kamatari was a versatile character actor who became a fixture in the
films of Kurosawa Akira. He began his career at age 15 with the Asakusa Opera
Company, performing until the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 forced the company
to disband. He then transitioned to comic theater, joining PCL (Toho's
predecessor) in the 1930s where he frequently appeared alongside the popular
comedian Enomoto Ken'ichi (aka "Enoken").

Fujiwara's collaboration with Kurosawa began with _Ikiru_ (1952) and spanned
over three decades. He is perhaps best known for his role as the bickering
peasant Matashichi in _The Hidden Fortress_ (1958). His pairing with Chiaki
Minoru in this film is widely cited as the inspiration for the droids C-3PO and
R2-D2 in George Lucas's _Star Wars_ (1977).

In _Seven Samurai_ (1954), Fujiwara played the memorable role of Manzô, the
fearful farmer who forcibly cuts his daughter's hair to disguise her as a boy.
Initially, Fujiwara played the character with more humor than Kurosawa intended,
leading to on-set disagreements. However, Kurosawa later acknowledged that
Fujiwara's interpretation added a necessary layer of humanity to the film.

Fujiwara continued to act until his death in 1985, leaving behind a legacy of
memorable supporting performances in some of Japanese cinema's greatest works.
