bio:
  - Began his career at age 15 with the Asakusa Opera Company, and continued to perform until the Great Kanto Earthquake, after which he transitioned to acting.
  - Joined PCL and appeared in comedies in the 30s alongside actor Enomoto Ken'ichi. Became an exclusive contract actor when PCL became Toho.
  - "His pairing with Chiaki Minoru in Kurosawa's <i>The Hidden Fortress</i> (1958) is often cited as an inspiration for R2-D2 and C-3PO in George Lucas' <i>Star Wars</i> (1977)."
  - "In early scenes of his peasant farmer character in <i>Seven Samurai</i> (1954), Fujiwara played it much more humorously than Kurosawa directed him, leading to disagreements. Later Kurosawa reviewed the film and observed Fujiwara's transformation into a more serious character as the story progressed. He realized that it was more effective because of the actor's decision and offered an apology."
