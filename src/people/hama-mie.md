Hama Mie was a prominent Toho actress during the 1960s, known for her comedic timing and international appeal. She was discovered by producer Tanaka Tomoyuki while working as a bus fare conductor and joined the studio in 1959.

She quickly became a popular leading lady, often starring in comedies alongside the Crazy Cats, such as *Irresponsible Yukyoden* and *Monsieur Zivaco*. She also appeared in the spy comedy *Key of Keys* (1965), which was later re-edited by Woody Allen into *What's Up, Tiger Lily?*.

Hama achieved international fame as the Bond girl Kissy Suzuki in *You Only Live Twice* (1967). Originally cast as the character Aki, she switched roles with co-star Wakabayashi Akiko due to difficulties with English dialogue. Despite the language barrier, her performance cemented her status as a global icon.

Following her departure from Toho in the 1970s, Hama transitioned to a successful career as a television host and author. She became a vocal advocate for environmental causes, dedicating herself to the preservation of Japan's natural landscapes and traditional culture.
