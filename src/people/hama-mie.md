Hama Mie was a prominent Toho actress during the 1960s, known for her comedic
timing and international appeal. She was discovered by producer Tanaka Tomoyuki
while working as a bus fare conductor and joined the studio in 1959.

She quickly became a popular leading lady, often starring in comedies alongside
the Crazy Cats, such as _Irresponsible Yukyoden_ and _Monsieur Zivaco_. She also
appeared in the spy comedy _Key of Keys_ (1965), which was later re-edited by
Woody Allen into _What's Up, Tiger Lily?_.

Hama achieved international fame as the Bond girl Kissy Suzuki in _You Only Live
Twice_ (1967). Originally cast as the character Aki, she switched roles with
co-star Wakabayashi Akiko due to difficulties with English dialogue. Despite the
language barrier, her performance cemented her status as a global icon.

Following her departure from Toho in the 1970s, Hama transitioned to a
successful career as a television host and author. She became a vocal advocate
for environmental causes, dedicating herself to the preservation of Japan's
natural landscapes and traditional culture.
