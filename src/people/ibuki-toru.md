Born Daimaru Chisato, Ibuki Tôru was a staple of Toho's science fiction films in the 1960s and 70s. With his sharp features and intense gaze, he was frequently typecast as a villain, henchman, or alien invader.

He is best remembered by _kaiju_ fans for his antagonistic supporting roles, such as one of Malmess's assassins in _Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster_ (1964) and a member of the X-_seijin_ invasion force in _Invasion of Astro-Monster_ (1965). He also played a rare sympathetic role in _Ebirah, Horror of the Deep_ (1966) as Yata, the lost brother whose disappearance sparks the film's adventure.

Following the collapse of Toho's contract system in the early 1970s, he migrated to television, appearing in various dramas and _tokusatsu_ series. After retiring from acting, he founded a company specializing in the manufacturing and sale of hydrogen water, operating under his birth name.
