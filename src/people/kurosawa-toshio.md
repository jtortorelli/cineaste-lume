No relation to the legendary director Kurosawa Akira, Kurosawa Toshio carved out
his own unique niche in the Japanese entertainment industry. He entered Toho as
a fresh face in the studio's 4th "New Face" competition in 1964, having dropped
out of high school to pursue acting.

He quickly made an impression with his intensity, most famously as the fanatical
Major Hatanaka Kenji in the war epic _Japan's Longest Day_ (1967), portraying
the officer's refusal to accept surrender with chilling conviction. After
leaving Toho in 1971 to freelance, he became a cult figure for his role as the
reporter Ashio Ryûrei in _Lady Snowblood_ (1973), a film that would later
inspire Quentin Tarantino.

A multi-talented performer, Kurosawa also enjoyed success as a singer, releasing
the hit song "Tokiniwa Shôfu no Yôni" in 1978. In 2008, he published a memoir
detailing his battle with colon cancer, which he was diagnosed with in 1992.
