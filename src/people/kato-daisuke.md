Katô Daisuke (born Katô Tokunosuke) was one of the most beloved and prolific
character actors in Japanese film history. Born into a distinguished theatrical
family in Tokyo's Asakusa district, his elder brother was the kabuki actor
Sawamura Kunitarô, and his elder sister was the actress Sawamura Sadako. He
initially followed in the family tradition, joining the Zenshinza Theatre
Company in 1933 and performing under the name Ichikawa Enji.

During World War II, Katô was drafted and sent to the front lines in New Guinea.
Amidst the harsh conditions, he organized theatrical performances to boost the
morale of his fellow soldiers. These experiences became the basis for his 1961
memoir _Snow in the South Seas_ (_Minami no shima ni yuki ga furu_), which was
subsequently adapted into both a television drama and a film (in which Katô
played himself).

After the war, Katô joined Daiei Studios and adopted the name Katô Daisuke. He
soon caught the eye of director Kurosawa Akira, who cast him as the bailiff in
_Rashomon_ (1950) and later as the loyal Shichirôji in _Seven Samurai_ (1954).
He became a regular in Kurosawa's stock company, appearing in films like _Ikiru_
(1952) and _Yojimbo_ (1961).

Moving to Toho in 1951, Katô found immense popularity in the comedy genre. His
cherubic face and warm demeanor made him perfect for the role of the loyal,
well-meaning subordinate in the long-running "Company President" (_Shachō_)
series, where he starred alongside Morishige Hisaya and Kobayashi Keiju. He won
Blue Ribbon Awards for Best Supporting Actor for _Mother_ (1952) and _Bloody
Spear at Mount Fuji_ (1955).

Katô continued acting well into his 60s. He died of colon cancer in 1975,
becoming the first of the _Seven Samurai_ cast to pass away. His son, Katô
Haruyuki, was briefly married to Kurosawa's daughter, Kazuko.
