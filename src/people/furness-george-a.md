George A. Furness was an American lawyer who played a significant role in
post-war Japan. A former Major in the United States Army, he served as a defense
counsel during the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (the Tokyo
Trials). He is most noted for his defense of former Foreign Minister Shigemitsu
Mamoru, who received a relatively light sentence and later returned to politics.

After the trials, Furness remained in Japan and established a private law
practice. Although not a professional actor, his dignified presence and fluency
in English made him a go-to choice for roles requiring Western authority
figures. He notably appeared as Dr. Svenson in _The Mysterians_ (1957) and as a
UN representative in _Gorath_ (1962).
