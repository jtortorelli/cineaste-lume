bio:
  - Served in the United States Army, retiring with the rank of Major.
  - Served as the defense counsel during the post-war Tokyo Trials for politician Shigemitsu Mamoru and Admiral Toyoda Soemu. Shigemitsu was targeted by the Soviet Union for punishment but received a lighter sentence. Toyoda was the only member of the Japanese military to be acquitted of all charges.
  - Shigemitsu helped Furness setup his own law practice in Japan.
  - Although not formally trained as an actor, Furness' popularity earned him the opportunity to appear on screen in small parts, often as Western dignitaries.
