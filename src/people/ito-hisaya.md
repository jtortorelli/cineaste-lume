A graduate of Hosei University, Itô Hisaya initially managed an electronics store before launching his acting career with Toei in 1954. He transferred to Toho in 1957, making his studio debut in _The Mysterians_.

Over the next decade, he became a fixture in Toho's science fiction and war films. His clean-cut yet intense features allowed him to play both authoritative figures—like the kidnapped scientist in _Atragon_ (1963) and Major Tada in _Destroy All Monsters_ (1968)—and cold-blooded villains.

His most iconic role is Malmess, the assassination squad leader in _Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster_ (1964). Interestingly, the part was originally written for Tsuchiya Yoshio, but Itô made the sunglasses-wearing villain distinctly his own.

After Toho's contract actor system was dismantled in 1970, he largely retired from film to focus on television work before eventually leaving the industry entirely. He passed away in 2005.
