A graduate of Hosei University, Itô Hisaya initially managed an electronics
store before launching his acting career with Toei in 1954. He transferred to
Toho in 1957, making his studio debut in _The Mysterians_.

Over the next decade, he became a fixture in Toho's science fiction and war
films. His clean-cut yet intense features allowed him to play both authoritative
figures—like the kidnapped scientist in _Atragon_ (1963) and Major Tada in
_Destroy All Monsters_ (1968)—and cold-blooded villains.

His most iconic role is Malmess, the assassination squad leader in _Ghidorah,
the Three-Headed Monster_ (1964). Interestingly, the part was originally written
for Tsuchiya Yoshio, but Itô made the sunglasses-wearing villain distinctly his
own.

After Toho's contract actor system was dismantled in 1970, he largely retired
from film to focus on television work before eventually leaving the industry
entirely. He passed away in 2005.
