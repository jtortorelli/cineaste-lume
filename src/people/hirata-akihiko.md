An intellectual and distinguished actor, Hirata Akihiko brought a sense of
gravity to his roles, making him a perfect fit for the scientists and military
officials he frequently portrayed.

Born in Gyeongseong (Seoul) during the Japanese occupation of Korea, he was
educated at the prestigious Tokyo University, where he graduated from the
Faculty of Law. He briefly worked in the business world at a trading company
that would become Mitsubishi Corporation before leaving to pursue acting,
joining the Haiyuza theater group in 1947.

He entered the film industry as part of Toho's 5th "New Face" class in 1953,
where he met his lifelong friend Sahara Kenji. He is immortalized in film
history for his role as the tormented Dr. Serizawa in the original _Godzilla_
(1954). The eyepatch he wore for the role became iconic; he donned it again for
a self-referential role in _Ebirah, Horror of the Deep_ (1966) and even wore it
to the press conference announcing _The Return of Godzilla_ (1984). He was
slated to star in that film, but his declining health forced him to withdraw,
and he passed away from lymphangiectasia shortly before filming began.

His career at Toho was prolific, appearing in nearly every major _kaiju_
franchise, including _Rodan_ (1956), _The Mysterians_ (1957), _Mothra_ (1961),
and _Terror of Mechagodzilla_ (1975). He often played the "monster killer," the
scientist who devises the solution to the threat. Beyond special effects films,
he worked with Kurosawa Akira in _Sanjuro_ (1962) and commanded the screen as
the villainous Mr. K in the cult TV series _Warrior of Love Rainbowman_ (1972).

Western fans may also know him from his appearance in the _Star Wolf_ TV series,
footage of which was re-edited into the _Fugitive Alien_ films and mocked on
_Mystery Science Theater 3000_. He was married to fellow actress Kuga Yoshiko.
