bio:
  - He had completed law school and was employed full time before he embraced acting.
  - Joined Toho as part of the 5th "New Face" class. He met fellow actor Sahara Kenji at this time and they remained close friends until Hirata's death.
  - Well known for playing the villainous Mr. K on TV's <i>Rainbowman</i>.
  - Made a cameo appearance in the <i>Star Wolf</i> TV series, later adapted into the <i>Fugitive Alien</i> films and featured on <i>Mystery Science Theater 3000</i>.
  - Known for the trademark eyepatch he wore when he played Dr. Serizawa in the original <i>Godzilla</i> (1954). He wore the patch again in <i>Ebirah, Horror of the Deep</i> (1966) and once more during the official press conference announcing production of <i>The Return of Godzilla</i> (1984). Hirata was originally meant to star in that film but failing health forced him to drop out, and he was replaced by Natsuki Yôsuke.
