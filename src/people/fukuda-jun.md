Fukuda Jun was a director who brought a distinct, energetic style to the
Godzilla franchise during the Showa era. Born in Manchuria, he joined Toho in
1946 and honed his craft as an assistant director under legends like Inagaki
Hiroshi and Honda Ishirô.

Unlike Honda's more somber and grounded approach, Fukuda's directorial style was
characterized by faster pacing, action-oriented storytelling, and a touch of
camp. He helmed five Godzilla films, starting with _Ebirah, Horror of the Deep_
(1966) and _Son of Godzilla_ (1967), and later directed 3 back-to-back entries
in the 70s: _Godzilla vs. Gigan_ (1972), _Godzilla vs. Megalon_ (1973), and
_Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla_ (1974).

Fukuda often collaborated with composer Satô Masaru, whose jazzy and upbeat
scores complemented Fukuda's dynamic visuals. He was also known for his hands-on
approach to special effects, often working closely with the effects team to
achieve his vision. Beyond kaiju films, he directed entries in the _Young Guy_
series and spy thrillers like _Ironfinger_ (1965) and _The Secret of the
Telegian_ (1960). His final film for Toho was the sci-fi spectacle _The War in
Space_ (1977).
