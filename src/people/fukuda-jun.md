Raised in Manchuria during the Japanese occupation. A poor student, he preferred
leisure activities to studying.

Recruited by Toho and became and assistant director under Inagaki Hiroshi and
Honda Ishirô.

His films tended to have more energy and movement than Honda's, and he preferred
to work with composer Satô Masaru to compliment his style.

Fukuda had a more hands-on approach to special effects than other directors, and
often tread into the "sacred territory" reserved for the effects staff
themselves.
