Harold Conway was an American businessman who worked as a tax accountant in
Japan before embarking on an acting career. He became a familiar face in
Japanese cinema, particularly in Toho's special effects films, where he often
played scientists, diplomats, or military officers.

His delivery of Japanese lines in _The Mysterians_ (1957) was considered
impressive for a non-native speaker. He returned in a similar role in the
spiritual sequel, _Battle in Outer Space_ (1959).

Conway appeared in scenes filmed specifically for the American release of
_Mothra vs. Godzilla_ (1964), known as _Godzilla vs. The Thing_. These scenes,
involving American missile cruisers attacking Godzilla, were not included in the
original Japanese version.

He continued to act in film and television until the mid-1970s, appearing in
series like _Ultraman_ and films such as _Genocide_ (1968).
