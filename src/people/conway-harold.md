Worked as a tax accountant in Japan before appearing in films playing foreign
speaking parts.

His delivery of his Japanese lines in <i>The Mysterians</i> (1957) was
considered impressive for a non-native speaker.

Conway appeared in scenes filmed for <i>Mothra vs. Godzilla</i> (1964) expressly
filmed for English speaking audiences, which weren't shown in the original
Japanese version.
