Nick Adams was born to a coal mining family. After his father was injured in a
mining accident, the family moved to Jersey City. An athlete in high school,
Adams was determined to become an actor and hitchhiked to Hollywood at age 18.
He struggled initially, taking odd jobs and serving in the United States Coast
Guard during the Korean War.

Adams began to find success with supporting roles in major films such as _Rebel
Without a Cause_ (1955) and _Picnic_ (1955). He became well-known for his
friendships with fellow actors James Dean and Elvis Presley, often using these
connections to generate publicity. His big break came with the starring role of
Johnny Yuma in the television series _The Rebel_ (1959–1961). In 1963, he
received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his
performance in _Twilight of Honor_.

In the mid-1960s, Adams starred in three Japanese films for Toho, all alongside
Mizuno Kumi. He played Dr. James Bowen in _Frankenstein Conquers the World_
(1965) and Astronaut Glenn in _Invasion of Astro-Monster_ (1965, also known as
_Monster Zero_). His third collaboration with Mizuno was _The Killing Bottle_
(1967), part of the _International Secret Police_ series of raucous action
films.

Adams was married to actress Carol Nugent, with whom he had two children. He
died under mysterious circumstances in Beverly Hills on February 7, 1968, at the
age of 36. The official cause of death was a drug overdose, but speculation
about the events surrounding his death continues.
