Anzai Kyôko began her career in entertainment as a member of the Osaka Shochiku Opera Company, where she performed from 1950 to 1953. Immediately after resigning from the opera company, she transitioned into film.

She made her film debut in 1953 and moved to Toho Studios in 1956, where she often took on leading roles. Despite a relatively short film career spanning less than a decade, she appeared in over 50 films, including the classic sci-fi film *Battle in Outer Space* (1959).

Anzai retired from acting completely in 1961 following her marriage to fellow actor Mihashi Tatsuya. They remained married until her death in 2002.
