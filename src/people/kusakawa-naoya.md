Kusakawa was born in Manchuria during the Japanese occupation, and spoke fluent
Chinese.

Became an exclusive contract actor for Toho in 1959 and appeared in a variety of
films, usually as a villain or a henchman.

Dropped out of acting in 1970 when Toho's contract system dissolved.

According to actor Amamoto Hideyo's memoirs, Kusakawa became a priest after his
retirement.
