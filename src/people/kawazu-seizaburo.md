Born Nakajima Seiichi in Tokyo, Kawazu Seizaburô had a rebellious start, running away from his adopted parents at age 17 to join an acting troupe in 1925. He made his screen debut in 1927 for Bantsuma-Universal, a unique but short-lived joint venture between Japanese star Bando Tsumasaburo and Universal Pictures.

After the studio dissolved, Kawazu worked with various companies before finding a home at PCL (Photo Chemical Laboratories), the predecessor to Toho, in 1937. There, he rose to prominence as a leading man in serious dramas, often mentioned alongside contemporary Takada Minoru. His career was briefly interrupted by a four-month stint in the military during the war.

In the post-war era, Kawazu transitioned into a prolific character actor, frequently cast as villains, corrupt officials, or gang bosses. He is perhaps best known to international audiences as the ruthless brothel owner Seibei in Kurosawa Akira's _Yojimbo_ (1961). He also appeared in several special effects films, such as _Mothra_ (1961) and _The Secret of the Telegian_ (1960).

He continued acting until his death from laryngeal cancer in 1983.
