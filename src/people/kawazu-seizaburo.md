In 1925 Kawazu ran away from his adopted parents (at age 17) and joined an
acting troupe.

Made his film debut in 1927 for Bantsuma-Universal studios, a joint
Japanese-American production company. The studio dissolved the following year
and Kawazu bounced around before landing at PCL, the predecessor to Toho,
in 1937.

His rise to acting fame in serious dramas coincided with his fellow actor Takada
Minoru.

He served in the military for all of 4 months, and then returned to acting.
