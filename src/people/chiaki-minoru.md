Chiaki Minoru aspired to be an actor since childhood and debuted in theater in
1936 at age 19. He served in the army from 1939 through 1942, stationed at
Sakhalin.

His performance in the play _Dataii_ inspired Kurosawa Akira to cast him in
_Stray Dog_ (1949). Chiaki went on to appear in eleven Kurosawa films, including
_Rashomon_ (1950), _Seven Samurai_ (1954), _Throne of Blood_ (1957), _The Hidden
Fortress_ (1958), and _High and Low_ (1963).

In _Seven Samurai_, he played the good-natured samurai Heihachi. Ironically, he
outlived all his co-stars from the film, despite being the first casualty on
screen. His and Fujiwara Kamatari's peasant characters in _The Hidden Fortress_
were cited as direct inspirations for R2-D2 and C-3PO in _Star Wars_ (1977).

Outside of his work with Kurosawa, Chiaki played the pilot Kobayashi Kôji in
_Godzilla Raids Again_ (1955).

Later in his career, he won the Best Actor award at the Japan Academy Prizes for
his performance in _Gray Sunset_ (1985), where he played a man suffering from
Alzheimer's disease.
