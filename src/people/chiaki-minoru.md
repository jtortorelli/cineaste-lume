bio:
  - Aspired to be an actor since childhood and debuted in theater in 1936 at age 19.
  - Served in the army from 1939 through 1942, stationed at Sakhalin.
  - His performance in the play "Dataii" inspired Kurosawa Akira to produce <i>The Quiet Duel</i> (1949) and to cast Chiaki in his first film role in <i>Stray Dog</i> (also 1949). Chiaki went on to appear in several Kurosawa films over the next decade.
  - His and Fujiwara Kamatari's peasant characters in <i>The Hidden Fortress</i> (1958) were cited as direct inspirations for R2-D2 and C-3PO in <i>Star Wars</i> (1977).
  - Ironically, he outlived all his co-stars from <i>Seven Samurai</i> (1954), despite being the first casualty in that film.
