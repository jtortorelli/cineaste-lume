A reliable supporting player for Toho, Ishida Shigeki (sometimes credited as Ishida Chihiro) appeared in dozens of films throughout the studio's golden age. His perennially concerned expression made him perfect for roles as nervous officials, skeptics, or worried citizens.

He was a frequent presence in _kaiju_ films, playing an MP in _Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster_ (1964), a newspaper editor in _Ebirah, Horror of the Deep_ (1966), and a weary apartment manager in _All Monsters Attack_ (1969). Beyond sci-fi, he was a regular in the popular _Crazy Cats_ comedy series.

After retiring from the screen, he returned to his hometown in Kanazawa to become the chief priest of a Buddhist temple. Upon his death in 1997, his son, the famous voice actor and actor Ishida Tarô (_Columbo_, _Castle of Cagliostro_), inherited his priesthood, continuing the family legacy.
