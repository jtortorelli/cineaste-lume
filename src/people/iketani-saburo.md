A professional broadcaster who leveraged his real-world skills into a film
career, Iketani Saburô was an announcer with TBS (Tokyo Broadcasting System)
during the 1960s and 70s.

Because of his clear, authoritative voice and professional demeanor, he was
frequently typecast as a news reader, radio announcer, or reporter in Toho's
science fiction films. He appeared in many of the genre's classics, including
the original _Godzilla_ (1954), _Rodan_ (1956), and _Mothra_ (1961), lending a
sense of realism to the fantastic events on screen.

Later in life, he remained connected to the genre, publishing exclusive
interviews with Toho stalwarts like Sakai Sachio and Tachibana Masaaki prior to
the release of _Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah_ (1991). He died of pneumonia
in 2002.
