Funato Jun was a Toho actor who appeared in several films during the 1960s. He
is perhaps best known to international audiences for his role as the Prince of
Ming in _The Lost World of Sinbad_ (1963). He also appeared in the science
fiction film _Dogora_ (1964) as Detective Nitta.

Following the decline of the Japanese film industry in the 1970s, Funato
transitioned to television, where he found steady work in dramas and _jidaigeki_
(period dramas). He was a frequent guest star in popular series such as _Mito
Komon_ and _Onihei Hankacho_.

He was married to actress Iwai Yumi.
