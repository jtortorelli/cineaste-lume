Funato Jun was a Toho actor who appeared in several films during the 1960s. He is perhaps best known to international audiences for his role as the Prince of Ming in *The Lost World of Sinbad* (1963). He also appeared in the science fiction film *Dogora* (1964) as Detective Nitta.

Following the decline of the Japanese film industry in the 1970s, Funato transitioned to television, where he found steady work in dramas and *jidaigeki* (period dramas). He was a frequent guest star in popular series such as *Mito Komon* and *Onihei Hankacho*.

He was married to actress Iwai Yumi.
