bio:
  - Member of the first graduating class of Nihon University College of Art Film Department in 1931.
  - Joined PCL in 1933 and studied under Yamamoto Kajirô, alongside Kurosawa Akira and Taniguchi Senkichi. Kurosawa and Honda would remain lifelong friends.
  - Served in the army in Manchuria during WWII. Passed through the ruins of Hiroshima on his train ride home after the war ended.
  - Known for his staunch pacificism, anti-nuclear sentiments, and optimism for international cooperation that he expressed on screen in works like <i>Godzlla</i> (1954), <i>The Mysterians</i> (1957), <i>Battle in Outer Space</i> (1959) and <i>Gorath</i> (1962).
  - Favored scientists and journalists for his protragonists and greedy, corrupt businessmen for his villains.
  - Preferred to act out each scene with his actors in advance.
  - Insisted on using higher quality, more costly single-camera setups while filming <i>Latitude Zero</i> over multi camera setups -- more suited to television -- demanded by American producers.
  - "Together with Tsuburaya Eiji, Ifukube Akira, and screenwriters Sekizawa Shin'ichi and Kimura Takeshi, formed the core creative team behind many of Toho's classic science fiction films."
  - Attempted to move the Godzilla series back towards its more serious roots with <i>Terror of Mechagodzilla</i> (1975). It would be his last film as director.
  - 'Guillermo del Toro''s monster film <i>Pacific Rim</i> (2013) is dedicated to both Honda and Ray Harryhausen. Gareth Edwards'' <i>Godzilla</i> (2014) features a character named "Ishiro Serizawa", played by Ken Watanabe, who is a tribute to both Honda and the Serizawa character from <i>Godzilla</i> (1954), originally played by Hirata Akihiko.'
