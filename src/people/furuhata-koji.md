Furuhata Kôji was a Japanese actor who is best known for his titular role in the
1965 film _Frankenstein Conquers the World_.

He began his career with the prestigious Shiki Theatre Company, where he built a
strong reputation as a stage actor. However, he was forced into early retirement
from the stage after suffering from hearing loss.

Despite his retirement, producer Tanaka Tomoyuki specifically sought him out for
the role of Frankenstein, believing his physical acting skills would be perfect
for the character. Furuhata accepted the role, which became his only film
appearance. Following the film's release, he retired from public life
completely.
