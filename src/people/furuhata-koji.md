Performed with the Shiki Theater Company until he became deaf and was forced
into early retirement.

Apparently his reputation with the theater company was such that Toho later
sought him out specifically to play the role of Frankenstein in <i>Frankenstein
Conquers the World</i> in 1965. It was his only film appearance and he retired
from public life afterwards.
