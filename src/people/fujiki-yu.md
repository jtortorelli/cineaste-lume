Fujiki Yû was a versatile actor who became a staple of Toho's "Golden Age"
cinema. He was a skilled fencer in his youth, winning the single men's epee
category of the All Japan Fencer's Championship in 1951 while attending Doshisha
University.

He joined Toho in 1954 as part of the 6th "New Face" class, which also included
future stars Takarada Akira, Sahara Kenji, and Okada Masumi. While initially
cast in serious roles, Fujiki found his niche in comedy, forming a popular duo
with Takashima Tadao. Together, they starred in numerous "salaryman" comedies, a
persona they carried over into kaiju films like _King Kong vs. Godzilla_ (1962)
and _Atragon_ (1963).

Fujiki's other notable tokusatsu roles include the egg-loving reporter Nakamura
Jirô in _Mothra vs. Godzilla_ (1964) and the advertising chief in _Space Amoeba_
(1970). He remained with Toho until 1974, after which he transitioned to
television roles.

In his later years, Fujiki battled diabetes, which led to a loss of sensation in
his extremities. He and his wife became active campaigners for diabetes
awareness. His final film role was in _Year One in the North_ (2005), released
shortly before his death.
