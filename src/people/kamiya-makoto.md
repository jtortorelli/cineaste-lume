Kamiya got his start as an assistant director under Kawakita Kôichi on the
Heisei Godzilla films, before jumping ship to work with Higuchi Shinji on the
Heisei Gamera films instead.

He assumed the title of Special Effects Director starting with <i>Whiteout</i>
in 2000. Kamiya has advocated for increased use of CGI over traditional
hand-made effects, perhaps due to Higuchi's influence.

Has collaborated frequently with director Satô Shinsuke on a string of
manga-to-film adaptations.
