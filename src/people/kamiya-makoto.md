Kamiya Makoto began his career in the special effects world in the late 1980s.
He started as an assistant director under Kawakita Kôichi on the Heisei Godzilla
series, beginning with _Godzilla vs. Biollante_ (1989). He subsequently joined
Higuchi Shinji's team as assistant special effects director for the acclaimed
Heisei Gamera trilogy (1995–1999).

Kamiya's big break as a special effects director came with _Whiteout_ (2000). He
returned to the _Godzilla_ franchise as the Director of Special Effects for the
hit film _Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack_
(2001), hand-picked by director Kaneko Shûsuke. He continued to balance
practical effects with the growing field of CGI, serving as SFX Director on
major live-action adaptations like _Gantz_ (2011), _I Am a Hero_ (2016), and
_Bleach_ (2018).

In addition to his effects work, Kamiya has directed full-length features, most
notably the CG-animated films _Resident Evil: Degeneration_ (2008) and _Resident
Evil: Damnation_ (2012). His frequent collaboration with director Satô Shinsuke
has led to his involvement as VFX Supervisor on the blockbuster _Kingdom_ film
series.
