Born in Tokyo, Koizumi Hajime graduated from the Japanese Film School in 1945
and immediately joined Toho's Cinematography Center. After serving as an
assistant cameraman for over a decade, he was promoted to cinematographer in
1956, making his debut on the color film _The Legend of the White Serpent_.

Koizumi is best remembered for his prolific and visually distinct collaboration
with director Honda Ishirô. Between 1957 and 1967, he served as the director of
photography on 17 of Honda's films, helping to define the colorful, widescreen
aesthetic of Toho's Golden Age tokusatsu. His credits include genre landmarks
such as _The Mysterians_ (1957), _Mothra_ (1961), _King Kong vs. Godzilla_
(1962), and the atmospheric horror film _Matango_ (1963).

Following _King Kong Escapes_ (1967), Koizumi left the film industry to work in
television, joining Eiji Tsuburaya's company. He worked as a special effects
director on _Ultra Q_ and later as a cinematographer for _Ultraman Ace_ in the
early 1970s.
