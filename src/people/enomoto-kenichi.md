Enomoto Ken'ichi, widely known as "Enoken," was a legendary Japanese singing comedian and actor, often referred to as the "Comedy King of Japan." He began his career in the chorus of the Asakusa Opera in 1922, inspired by stars like Taya Rikizô. Following the Great Kantô Earthquake of 1923, he transitioned to comic theater, eventually forming his own troupe, the Enoken Gekidan.

Enoken's popularity skyrocketed in the 1930s, and he became a major film star, appearing in numerous comedies and parodies of historical figures. His energetic style and fast-paced delivery drew comparisons to Western comedians like Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. He collaborated with notable directors such as Yamamoto Kajirô and Kurosawa Akira (in *The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail*).

In the 1950s, Enomoto suffered a severe setback when necrosis led to the amputation of his right leg. Inspired by Harold Lloyd, who also performed despite injury, Enomoto made a legendary comeback in 1963 at the Shinjuku Koma Theater, using a prosthetic leg and even incorporating it into his comedy routines.

Though his health declined in later years, Enomoto remains a pivotal figure in the history of Japanese comedy. His tombstone bears the inscription: "The King of Comedy Enoken rests here."
