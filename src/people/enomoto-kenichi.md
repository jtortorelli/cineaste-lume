bio:
  - Made his debut in a Japanese production of the opera <i>Carmen</i>, singing in the chorus.
  - A talented singer who worked with Columbia, Victor and Polydor in Japan. He leveraged his improvisational skills to make the leap to film.

  - Formed a comedy duo with fellow actor Yanagiya Kingoro.
  - He went through a depression in 1952 after an on-set accident later cost him his leg and his oldest son died suddenly.
