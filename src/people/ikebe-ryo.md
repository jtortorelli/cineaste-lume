Graduated from film school in 1941. Originally aspired to be a director but
there were limited career opportunities due to the war effort. Took some small
acting roles before he was drafted and sent to China.

In 1944 his transport ship sunk and he was adrift for 10 hours before being
rescued.

Persuaded to resume acting after the war by director Ichikawa Kon.

Established himself in the 40s and 50s, appearing in dramas, romances, and
gangster films.

Became president of the Japan Actors Guild in 1965. During his tenure he dealt
with a gun-running scandal involving actors and <i>yakuza</i>.

Also in 1965 he left Toho and founded his own production company. The company
floundered and left him saddled with debt. Fellow actor Takakura Ken invited
Ikebe to co-star with him in the <i>Brutal Tales of Chivalry</i> series, marking
Ikebe's late career comeback.
