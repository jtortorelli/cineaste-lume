bio:
  - Graduated from film school in 1941. Originally aspired to be a director but there were limited career opportunities due to the war effort. Took some small acting roles before he was drafted and sent to China.
  - In 1944 his transport ship sunk and he was adrift for 10 hours before being rescued.
  - Persuaded to resume acting after the war by director Ichikawa Kon.
  - Established himself in the 40s and 50s, appearing in dramas, romances, and gangster films.
  - Became president of the Japan Actors Guild in 1965. During his tenure he dealt with a gun-running scandal involving actors and <i>yakuza</i>.
  - Also in 1965 he left Toho and founded his own production company. The company floundered and left him saddled with debt. Fellow actor Takakura Ken invited Ikebe to co-star with him in the <i>Brutal Tales of Chivalry</i> series, marking Ikebe's late career comeback.
