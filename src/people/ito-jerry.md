Jerry Itô was born in New York City to a distinguished show business family. His
father was the internationally renowned dancer and choreographer Itô Michio, and
his mother was the dancer Hazel Wright. He was also the nephew of actor Senda
Koreya and set designer Itô Kisaku.

Itô served in the United States Navy during World War II, taking part in the
initial occupation of Japan. After his service, he studied acting at the
American Theatre Wing and the Actors Studio in New York, making his Broadway
debut in _Teahouse of the August Moon_ in 1953. He was later recalled to active
duty during the Korean War.

Moving to Japan to reconnect with his family, Itô found success in the
entertainment industry as a bilingual television host and film actor. He signed
with Toho's stage division but was frequently loaned to other studios to play
Western characters. He is best known to genre fans for his role as the
villainous Clark Nelson in _Mothra_ (1961), as well as appearances in _The
Manster_ (1959), _The Last War_ (1961), and _Message from Space_ (1978).

From 1995 to 1997, he appeared as "Grandpa Jerry" in the third series of NHK's
educational program _Let's Play in English_. He suffered a cerebral hemorrhage
before the show completed its run and was replaced by Dennis Falt. Itô
subsequently moved to Los Angeles, California, where he lived until his death
from pneumonia in 2007.
