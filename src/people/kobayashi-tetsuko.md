Born in Tokyo, Kobayashi Tetsuko is best known to international audiences for her commanding performance as the Empress of Mu in the 1963 Toho sci-fi film _Atragon_. Director Honda Ishirô reportedly cast her after spotting her working diligently on a television production at the studio, impressed by her energy and work ethic. She notably applied her own makeup for the iconic role.

Her other credits include _Samurai Rebellion_ (1967) and _The Blazing Sword_ (1966). After a hiatus from acting between 1967 and 1982, she returned to the screen for a brief second phase of her career. Kobayashi passed away from lung cancer in 1994 at the age of 53.
