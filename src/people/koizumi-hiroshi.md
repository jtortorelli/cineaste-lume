Born in Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture, Koizumi Hiroshi graduated from Keio University with a degree in economics in 1948. He initially worked as an announcer for NHK before transitioning to acting, joining Toho as part of their 3rd "New Face" class.

Debuting in 1952, Koizumi became a staple of Toho's golden age, particularly in the tokusatsu genre where his intellectual demeanor often saw him cast as scientists or academics. His credits include _Mothra_ (1961), _Matango_ (1963), _Atragon_ (1963), and _Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster_ (1964). He also played the heroic pilot Tsukioka in _Godzilla Raids Again_ (1955).

In the 1970s, he returned to his roots in broadcasting, becoming the host of the popular _Quiz Grand Prix_ on Fuji TV. He made a memorable return to the Godzilla franchise in _Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S._ (2003), reprising his role as Dr. Chûjô Shin'ichi from _Mothra_—a span of 42 years between appearances.

Koizumi passed away from pneumonia in 2015.
