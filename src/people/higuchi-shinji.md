A pivotal figure in modern Japanese special effects and animation, Higuchi Shinji is renowned for revolutionizing the _tokusatsu_ genre and for his creative partnership with An'no Hideaki.

Born in Tokyo, his passion for special effects was ignited by childhood visits to Toho Studios. He entered the industry straight out of high school, landing an uncredited role on _The Return of Godzilla_ (1984) as a modeler and assistant for suit actor Satsuma Kenpachirô. That same year, he became a founding member of Gainax, where he worked as a storyboard artist and writer on seminal anime productions like _Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise_ (1987) and _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ (1995)—the protagonist of which, Ikari Shinji, bears his name.

Higuchi's most significant early contribution to live-action cinema was as the Special Effects Director for Kaneko Shusuke's Heisei _Gamera_ trilogy (1995–1999). He was praised for modernizing the _kaiju_ aesthetic, blending traditional suitmation with CGI and dynamic, low-angle cinematography to create a sense of scale and realism previously unseen in the genre. This work earned him a Special Technology Award at the Japan Academy Prizes.

He made his feature directorial debut with the submarine thriller _Lorelei: The Witch of the Pacific Ocean_ (2005) and continued to direct major spectacles like _The Sinking of Japan_ (2006) and the live-action _Attack on Titan_ films (2015).

In recent years, he has reunited with An'no to helm the "Shin Japan Heroes Universe." This collaboration produced the critical and commercial juggernaut _Shin Godzilla_ (2016), which he co-directed; both Higuchi and An'no were recognized with the Best Director award at the Japan Academy Prizes. He followed this success by directing _Shin Ultraman_ (2022), continuing his lifelong dedication to reimagining Japan's most iconic special effects heroes for a contemporary audience.
