Born in Essex, England, to a large family, Hodgson ran away from boarding school
at age 13 to become a sailor. Though he was initially returned home, he
eventually gained his father's permission to apprentice in the merchant navy.
The harsh conditions and bullying he faced at sea drove him to a rigorous
physical training regimen, and he became a renowned bodybuilder.

During his years at sea, he also developed a keen interest in photography,
documenting life aboard ships and natural phenomena like typhoons and sharks. He
was awarded a medal by the Royal Humane Society for saving a fellow sailor in
shark-infested waters.

After retiring from the sea, he opened a school of physical culture, but it
failed to be profitable. He turned to writing, drawing heavily on his maritime
experiences to craft atmospheric horror and weird fiction. His works, including
_The Boats of the "Glen Carrig"_ (1907), _The House on the Borderland_ (1908),
_The Ghost Pirates_ (1909), and _The Night Land_ (1912), often featured cosmic
horror themes and the terrifying unknown of the ocean. He also created the
occult detective Thomas Carnacki.

Despite never achieving financial stability, his work was highly influential,
notably praised by H.P. Lovecraft for its power to evoke "cosmic terror." His
short story _The Voice in the Night_ has been adapted multiple times, including
for the Japanese film _Matango_ (1963).

He married in 1913 and moved to the south of France, but returned to England to
enlist when World War I broke out. Despite being 40 years old and previously
injured, he insisted on returning to the front lines. He was killed by an
artillery shell at the Fourth Battle of Ypres in April 1918.
