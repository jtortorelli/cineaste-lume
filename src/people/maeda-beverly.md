Born to an American father and Japanese mother. The name "Beverly" is from her paternal grandmother. Studied ballet as a child.

Joined Toho after placing in a music competition, and made her film debut in 1964.

In 1966 at age 18 she became the face of Shiseido Cosmetics.

Married fellow singer Mike Maki in 1968 and traveled with him to the United States. Their busy touring schedule strained their relationship and they divorced in 1976. Maeda returned to Japan.

Maeda practiced dancing for 3 months to land the role of Sheila in the Japanese stage production of _A Chorus Line_ in 1979. She followed up with appearances in _Gone with the Wind_, _West Side Story_, _Cabaret_, _Les Miserables_ and _Mamma Mia!_.
