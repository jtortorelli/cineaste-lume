Active in both acting and football while in college.

Co-founded theater companies both before and after the war. His post-war company floundered during Japan's bleak economy and was forced to disband. Matsumura entered TV instead and gradually transitioned into film.

Appeared in films for notable directors like Kobayashi Masaki (_Hara-Kiri_, 1962), Yamada Yôji (_The Lovable Tramp_, 1966) and Kurosawa Akira (_Dodes'kaden_, 1970).

Matsumura played the lead role in Kurosawa's posthumously released work _Madadayo_ (1993), for which he was nominated for the Japanese Academy Prize for Best Actor.
