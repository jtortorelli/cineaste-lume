Initially, Kobayashi rejected numerous offers to join Toho as an actress in
order to pursue her education. When she failed her university entrance exams,
she relented and auditioned for Toho.

Her debut film was for director Honda Ishirô, a non-<i>kaiju</i> film called
<i>Come Marry Me</i> in 1966.

She retired from acting in the early 70s, shortly after Toho's contract system collapsed.

Kobayashi appeared in the KaijuCast original documentary <i>All Hail the King</i> alongside fellow actors Takarada Akira, Kubo Akira, and Tsuchiya Yoshio.
