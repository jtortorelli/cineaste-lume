A dedicated fixture of Toho Studios for decades, Kumagai Takuzô was an exclusive
player who reportedly lived within a three-minute walk of the studio lot during
its peak years. This proximity and his reliability led to him appearing in
countless films, including over 20 science fiction productions.

Though often relegated to background parts or non-speaking roles, he had
memorable turns as Gisaku's son in Kurosawa Akira's _Seven Samurai_ (1954), a
defense minister in the original _Godzilla_ (1954), and a newspaper executive in
_The Human Vapor_ (1960). His career spanned the breadth of Toho's Golden Age,
from the chanbara classics of the 50s to the special effects extravaganzas of
the 70s.
