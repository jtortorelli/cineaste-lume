Echigo Ken joined Toho as part of the second "New Face" program in 1947. He
became a reliable supporting actor, appearing in numerous films throughout the
1950s and 1960s, particularly in the science fiction genre.

While often cast in uncredited bit parts, Echigo had memorable roles in several
classic tokusatsu films. He played the harmonica-playing sailor on the
_Eiko-maru_ in the original _Godzilla_ (1954) and had a more prominent role as
the SY-3 crew member Yoshikawa in _Destroy All Monsters_ (1968). His other
credits include _Rodan_ (1956), _The Mysterians_ (1957), and _Mothra vs.
Godzilla_ (1964).

Echigo retired from acting in 1971. In his later years, he reportedly worked at
a coffee shop near Toho studios with fellow actor Iwamoto Koji. He was an avid
clay pigeon shooter.

His death was confirmed by his widow, actress Terasawa Hiroko, in a 2014
interview, though the exact date remains unknown.
