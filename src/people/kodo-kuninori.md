Born before the turn of the century, Kôdô was well advance din years when Japanese film hit its stride, and as such frequently played aged, senior roles.

He notably played village chiefs in three films released in short succession: <i>Seven Samurai</i>, <i>Godzilla</i>, and <i>Half Human</i>.

His name is often misread as Kôdô Kokuten, and he was allegedly addressed as "Kokuten" on set. He was wont to respond to those mispronouncing his name with a forceful "KUNINORI!"
