Born Tanikawa Saichirô in Hyogo Prefecture, Kôdô Kuninori began his acting
career in 1901 on the _shinpa_ stage. Before World War II, he worked at Teikoku
Kinema and with Ichikawa Utaemon's productions before officially joining Toho
in 1939.

Due to his advanced age by the time Japanese cinema entered its golden age, Kôdô
was frequently type-cast in senior roles. He famously played the village elder
in three major films released in short succession: the patriarch Gisaku in
Kurosawa Akira's _Seven Samurai_ (1954), the Ôdo Island elder in _Godzilla_
(1954), and the village chief in _Half Human_ (1955).

His professional name was often misread as "Kôdô Kokuten," and he was allegedly
addressed as "Kokuten" on set by colleagues. He was known to respond to such
mispronunciations with a forceful correction: "KUNINORI!"

Kôdô passed away in 1960.
