Beginning his tenure at Toho with uncredited walk-ons and bit parts, Kuno
Seishirô gradually worked his way up the studio ranks. He eventually secured
more substantial parts, most notably in 1967 when he played the assassin on
crutches in the action-comedy _The Age of Assassins_ and the scientist Tashiro
in the kaiju film _Son of Godzilla_.

He was known to be close friends with Toho superstar Kayama Yûzô, famous for the
_Young Guy_ series.

Like many contract players, Kuno left the industry as the studio system
collapsed in the 1970s, retiring from acting altogether by the early 1980s. In
2010, he was reportedly running a butcher shop in Tokyo.
