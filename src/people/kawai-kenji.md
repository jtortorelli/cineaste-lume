Born in Shinagawa, Tokyo, Kawai Kenji originally studied nuclear engineering at
Tokai University before dropping out to pursue music at the Shobi Music Academy.
He formed the fusion rock band "Muse" and, after the band dissolved, began
composing for commercials and television dramas.

His career breakthrough came after meeting director Oshii Mamoru, leading to
their first collaboration on _The Red Spectacles_ (1987). Kawai has since scored
all of Oshii's major works, including the internationally acclaimed _Ghost in
the Shell_ (1995) and its 2004 sequel, for which he received an Annie Award
nomination.

Kawai is also known for his long-standing partnership with horror director
Nakata Hideo on the _Ring_ franchise and _Dark Water_, as well as his stirring
scores for Hong Kong action films like the _Ip Man_ series and _Seven Swords_.
His distinctive sound often merges traditional Asian instrumentation with modern
electronic elements and percussion, which he frequently performs himself.

His vast body of work extends to the _Ultraman_ franchise (scoring _Ultraman
Nexus_ and _Ultraman Geed_) and recent hits like _The Birth of Kitaro: The
Mystery of GeGeGe_ (2023). In 2007, he produced and performed in a concert of
his film works titled "Cinema Symphony."
