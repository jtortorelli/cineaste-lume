Descended from a long line of village priests in Saitama.

Supported himself through high school by working as a milk delivery boy,
newspaper delivery boy, and construction worker.

Originally desired to become a dancer, but pivoted to acting when his local
dancing troupe disbanded. He joined a theater company and toured China in 1926.

Developed gangrene in both legs in 1935. He accepted the painful condition
rather than amputate his legs and risk his acting career. The condition
contributed to his hunched posture and geriatric performances in later films. He
required crutches for normal movement.

He played a drunken old man in the first <i>Gamera</i> film in 1965, which
featured as an episode on <i>Mystery Science Theater 3000</i> in the 90s. His
character's impeccably delivered [dubbed] line, "It must have been one of those
flying saucers I've heard them talk about so much about lately," became a
recurring joke on
<i>MST3K</i>.
