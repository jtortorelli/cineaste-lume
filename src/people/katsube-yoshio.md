Born in Ota, Shimane Prefecture, Katsube Yoshio began his career as a trainee at
the Imperial Theatre while still a university student in 1953. He became a
formal member the following year and signed an exclusive contract with Toho
in 1955.

Katsube made his [credited] screen debut in the 1956 film _The Legend of the
White Serpent_. Distinguished by his thick eyebrows and youthful appearance, he
became a reliable supporting player for the studio, frequently cast as
reporters, villagers, or military personnel in Toho's special effects
productions.

Over the course of two decades, he appeared in a reported 327 films, including
many entries in the Godzilla series and other sci-fi classics.

He retired from acting in 1976 after his appearance in _Samurai of the Sky_,
returning to his hometown in Shimane to take over the family business. He passed
away in 2023.
