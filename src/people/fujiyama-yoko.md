Fujiyama Yôko was a Toho actress who rose to prominence after graduating from
the studio's "New Face" class in 1961. She made her debut in the first
installment of the popular _Young Guy_ (_Wakadaishô_) series, starring opposite
Kayama Yûzô.

She became a familiar face in Toho's productions during the 1960s, frequently
appearing in comedies and science fiction films. She is well-known to tokusatsu
fans for her roles as the heroine Jinguji Makoto in _Atragon_ (1963) and Kirino
Masayo in _Dogora_ (1964). Fujiyama also had a recurring on-screen partnership
with actor Natsuki Yôsuke, often cast as his sister in various films.

After a relatively short career, she retired from acting in 1967 upon her
marriage. Fujiyama passed away in 2022 from a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
