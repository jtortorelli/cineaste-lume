Fujiyama Yôko was a Toho actress who rose to prominence after graduating from the studio's "New Face" class in 1961. She made her debut in the first installment of the popular *Young Guy* (*Wakadaishô*) series, starring opposite Kayama Yûzô.

She became a familiar face in Toho's productions during the 1960s, frequently appearing in comedies and science fiction films. She is well-known to tokusatsu fans for her roles as the heroine Jinguji Makoto in *Atragon* (1963) and Kirino Masayo in *Dogora* (1964). Fujiyama also had a recurring on-screen partnership with actor Natsuki Yôsuke, often cast as his sister in various films.

After a relatively short career, she retired from acting in 1967 upon her marriage. Fujiyama passed away in 2022 from a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
